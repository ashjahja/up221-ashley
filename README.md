## Hello! My name is Ashley Jahja and I'm an MPH student in the Environmental Health Sciences Department at Fielding School of Public Health. 
My academic background is mostly in environmental studies, having received a B.S. in Society and Environment from UC Berkeley. I hope to merge environmental concepts with public health and social equity. _I'm also from Indonesia so when I'm not in America, I like to go foraging and snorkelling._

## My objective for the class is to get more familiar with GIS and coding to expand my skills. 
A lot of the work in public health and environmental science deals with geospatial data. My project ideas centre around environmental racism and health equity.
