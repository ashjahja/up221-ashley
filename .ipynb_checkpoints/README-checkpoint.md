## Hello! My name is Ashley Jahja and I'm an MPH student in the Environmental Health Sciences Department at Fielding School of Public Health. 
My academic background is mostly in environmental studies, having received a B.S. in Society and Environment from UC Berkeley. I hope to merge environmental concepts with public health and social equity. _I'm also from Indonesia :indonesia: so when I'm not in America, I like to go foraging and snorkelling._

## Project Ideas
My ideas are pretty raw, but I'd love to do a heat map of environmental exposures and how they pertain to BIPOC communities. Anything that combines public health, urban planning and environmental justice, I am game for. 
## My objective for the class is to get more familiar with GIS and coding to expand my skills. 
A lot of the work in public health and environmental science deals with geospatial data. My project ideas centre around environmental racism and health equity. I have minimal/no experience with coding so it's exciting to learn a new skill!
